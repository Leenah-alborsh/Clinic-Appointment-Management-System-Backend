Biggest Docker Problem

The main Docker issue I faced was container name and port conflicts while running the application multiple times.
Sometimes the container failed to start because a previous container was still using the same name or port.

I solved this by checking running containers, stopping and removing unused ones, and rebuilding the image cleanly.
This helped me understand Docker container lifecycle and proper container management.

The most important lesson I learned is that Git commits should clearly reflect real progress.
Writing meaningful commit messages and using pull requests made the project easier to follow and more professional.

This assignment showed me how GitHub is used to document development steps, not just store code.
